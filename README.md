# KPI WITH POWERBI

Streamlining report building with PowerBI and PowerShell

This is a work-based project

Name: Anders Ingelsten - 20095402

## General Overview.

Previously data for KPI reports within the organisation was pulled manually from local hosted, as well as remote cloud-based systems. The data was then processed by staff into report visuals.

This project objective was to streamline and automate this process. By for example pulling data via system APIs and then making it available to PowerBI by storing it into the organisations SharePoint Online as CSV Data. PowerBI, in conjunction with the formula language DAX, was then utilised as the visualisation tool, to display the stored data, as up to date organisational interactive KPI reporting diagrams on the companyâ€™s intranet. 

PowerShell was used as the scripting language to facilitate the data pull and storage. Automation was then applied to the data pull and the PowerBI data refresh.
